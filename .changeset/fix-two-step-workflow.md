**Changesets Workflow Fix**

- **Fixed**: Split changesets workflow into proper two-step process (version PR â†’ publish)
- **Changed**: Moved JSR publishing to separate workflow triggered only after Version Packages PR is merged
- **Improved**: Publish step now runs `bun run build` before publishing to ensure package is ready
